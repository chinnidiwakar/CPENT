Hacker used FTP to steal data and send to malicious Server
Company got doubt, so they blocked OUTGOING 21 FTP

Hacker Tries To Use Tunneling Mechanism.

At Home Setup a Relay Machine to Process TUnnel Data and Send it to server
Disable Firewall
Setup password in htthost
Check Two Boxes and Click Apply

After that go to office and send traffic to Relay via tunnel
Install httport
In Port Mapping Map local and remote 21 port with Target IP as Remote Host
In Proxy Give Relay IP, Relay Port, BypassMode as Remote Host and Password and Start tunnel

Try to connect to Loopback IP on blocked port, you should be able to reach the target via Relay Tunnel
